# Assignment_4

This assignment has two major parts which will show that you know how to implement two different kinds of sklearn models to create predictors.

1. Use a linear regression model with the Boston housing data set. Your code should then return which factor has the largest effect on the price of housing in Boston. (This is not the correlation coefficient. This is the absolute value of the slope.)

2. Use a KMeans regression model with the Iris data set. Graph the fit when using differing numbers of clusters. Graph the result and either corroborate or refute the assumption that the data set represents 3 different varieties of iris.
